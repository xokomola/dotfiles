# My dotfiles

Config files and scripts that customize my development environment.

No effort was made to make this safe for anyone except an `install.sh` that sets up symlinks and we can edit files outside of the real `.config` directory.

I used [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) for reference.
